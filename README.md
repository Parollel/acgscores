# A Repository for ACG Music Scores

This repository contains the music scores for the ACG songs I like. The scores are written in LilyPond.

## Compiling

I am a beginner of Lilypond and I have been focusing on the completion of music scores rather than the compilation process. Currently you shall use the following command to compile the scores:

```lilypond -o _target/ <score>.ly```

And the pdf file will be generated in the `target/` directory. Generated midi file may lack of appropriate effects. PRs are welcome.

On linux systems you can simply run

```./build.sh```

to compile all the scores.

## Copyright

The original songs are written by their respective authors. I do not own the original songs, and I do not claim to own them. The scores are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). You are free to share and adapt the scores, but you must give appropriate credit, and you must not use the scores for commercial purposes.
